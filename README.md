## Drupal Media - AI Image Generation

This module adds a new Media Type for Generated Image. You can connect an AI provider for image generation from your site's list of AI provders.

The form for Generated Image currently generates an image and autosaves it to your Media Library.

### In Progress

- Adjusting the Generated Image save form to allow for editing the Media items details
- Fix a bug that creates two Images on Generate
- Add alt text field that integrates well with AI Alt Text module
